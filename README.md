# Namespace and scope in python<br>
## Namespace:<br>
In python namespace is which give the uniqe name to each object(variable,method).<br>
## Types of namespace:<br>
Gobal namespace:These names are accessible whole the code.<br>
loca namespace: Accessible only within the current function.<br>
and built namespace: They are already present in python.(like print, len, etc).<br>
## Scope:<br>
Scope give the particular rigion from where we can access objects in python.so,we can not access the objects anywhere from code.Accessing is allowed by the scope of object.<br>
## Types of scope<br>
Global scope,local,scope,built-in scope<br>

# Statement indentation and comments in python<br>
## Statement:<br>
Statement is the single line code which performs actions.It can be an assignment(x=5), a function call like print(x) e.t.c. 
## Indentation:<br>
Indentation is the spaces in code.Proper indentation ensures that your code is organized and readable. 
## Comments:<br>
Comments are like the note which is written by programmer during the coding to remember thier code.<br>
In python for single comment we use #.And for multiple comments we use """ this in starting end at ending.<br>
<br>
# Structuring in python program<br>
The structure Python Program consists of three files such as : a.py,b.py and c.py. <br>
Structuring a Python program means arranging your code in a clear and organized manner.<br>
So, that it's easy to read, easy to keep up, and can be worked on by multiple people together.<br>

# How to chek if the string is valid keyword in python?<br>
When we use the keyword as a string in our program then interpreter gives error.<br>
To check the validity of string 1st we import the keyword library module.This module gives a function called iskeyword() that we can use to identify that string is a reserved keyword in Python or not.<br>
<br>
# How to assign values to variables in python and other languages?<br>
## In Python,<br>
you can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (=).<br>
They must start with a letter or an underscore.<br>
## In other programming languages,<br>
the process of assigning values to variables is similar to Python.<br>
but they are different in syntax and rules.<br>
<br>
## How to print without newline in python?<br>
In Python, you can print without a newline character by using the 'end=" parameter of the print() function.<br>
By add this '\n' we get the new line so to change this behaviour we use 'end=""' to print without new line.<br>
## For example:<br>
print("Hello, world!", end="") <br>
<br>
## Decision making:<br>
A decision-making process is a series of steps taken by an individual,<br>
to choosing between different alternative to meet thier needs.<br>
